# Deep-Learning-Generative-Adversarial-Networks
Deep neural networks are typically used for supervised learning tasks like classification and regression. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), however, serve a different purposeâ€”generative modeling, an unsupervised learning approach that enables models to learn patterns in data and generate new, realistic examples from it.
